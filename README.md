### Jonathan Pace - Software Portfolio 
#### **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathancpace)**

This GitHub account is used as a **working portfolio** for independant software projects that I have created independently. 

Projects here are designed to highlight:
- structure
- design decisions
- clarity and reasoning

### How to Read the Repositories

This is not a collection of code snippets or tutorials.  Each repository is meant to stand on its own as a complete, readable project.

Most projects will include:
- a clear problem statement
- an explanation of constraints and assumptions
- notes on design choices and tradeoffs
- areas for future extension or refactoring

---

### Projects
**Coming Soon...
Projects are actively being prepared and added.  
Early repositories may focus more on **design and clarity** than production completeness.
